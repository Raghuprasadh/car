            At the beginning of the '90s, the world was boiling. More people started to ask for higher performance but still reasonably-priced vehicles. Apart from the rally-specced Celica, Toyota also offered the Supra IV, which entered the competition against Porsche 968, 
            Nissan 300ZX Turbo, or the Corvette LT1, to name just a few.Designed in the traditional way of a GT, with a long hood and swept-back rear end, the Supra IV impressed with its low stance and big headlights covered under a clear lens. 
            Its lower grille, placed in the apron, was the one that ensured the cooling, while the side scoops were for the front rotors. On the turbocharged version, the carmaker added an air intake on the hood for selected markets

            Skyline specialist Middlehurst Motorsport had brought in 100 R33s and when the R34 came along Nissan GB wanted to bring the car officially into the UK itself. 
            There would be a delay, though, because although the all-wheel drive running gear was lightly stressed by the stock ‘276bhp’, it wanted to add a package of upgrades
             to protect the car in the event of sustained autobahn running – oil coolers for the engine, gearbox and AWD transfer box. There was a new engine ECU too and, completing the mods, the interior was enhanced with Connolly leather-trimmed seats.
